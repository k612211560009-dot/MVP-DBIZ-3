## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Database performance**: Implement indexing and query optimization early
- **Integration failures**: Build robust mock services with fallback mechanisms
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Adopt mobile-first design approach

### Project Risks

- **Scope creep**: Strict adherence to MVP features only
- **Timeline delays**: Weekly progress reviews and adjustments
- **Resource constraints**: Prioritize core functionality first
